SpriteKit-Breakout
==================

I made this demonstration app to learn SpriteKit.  The SpriteKit tutorial I did first only used actions to move objects, and I found I needed to learn other ways to move things.  In this demo, the ball moves with physics, and the paddle moves left and write when the user touches certain regions of the screen.
